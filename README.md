# columnwise

`columnwise` explores data engineering in Julia. The repository keeps the core rule set compact, then surrounds it with examples that show how the decisions move.

## Columnwise Notes

The quickest review path is the verifier first, then the fixtures, then the operations note. That order makes it easy to see whether the code, data, and explanation still agree.

## Why This Exists

This project keeps the domain idea close to the tests. That makes it useful as a reference implementation, a small experiment, or a starting point for a more specialized tool.

## Example Scenarios

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Implementation Notes

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The Julia project keeps the model in a small module with assertions in a local test script.

## Feature Notes

- Models schema drift with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep lineage checks changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for pipeline state, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents quality gates tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Try It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Tests

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Code Tour

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Roadmap

- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Add one more data engineering fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Boundaries

The fixture set is deliberately small. That keeps the review surface clear, but it also means the model should not be treated as a complete domain simulator.

## Local Setup

The only required setup is the local Julia toolchain. After cloning, stay in the repo root so fixture paths resolve correctly.
